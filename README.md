# W.I.P

# cybersec-DiagDoctor
Project firstly for the "Special Topics in Information Security" discipline. 

The project is capable of verify the ports of a host and return the open http or https ones.

Usage:
  {} <host>
  <host> - the URL or IP adress of the host.


#Future:
1.  In (maybe) a not so long future, this basic service may be capable of performing web crawling to scan links inside those http or https services and act recursively searching for more links
2.  The final intention is to implement an Automatized PenTest service, so, eventualy more details will be given
